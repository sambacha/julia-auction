# Core Concepts

## Auction Mechanisms

### Uniform Price Auctions
All winners pay the same clearing price, determined by the marginal bid.

### The Bid Shading Problem
In traditional uniform price auctions, bidders strategically underbid to maximize profits. This leads to:
- Inefficient allocation
- Reduced seller revenue
- Price manipulation by large bidders

### Our Solution: Augmented Mechanisms

#### 1. Elastic Supply
Supply adjusts dynamically based on demand:
```julia
S(p) = S₀ × elasticity_function(p, parameters)
```

#### 2. Advanced Tie-Breaking
Margin-based allocation that considers:
- Price aggressiveness
- Quantity impact
- Historical behavior

## CFMM Settlement

### What is CFMM?
Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) are automated liquidity pools that enable decentralized trading.

### Integration Benefits
- Improved price discovery
- MEV capture as user surplus
- Atomic settlement guarantees
- Sub-100ms execution

### Routing Optimization
Our system finds optimal paths across multiple pools:
- Minimizes price impact
- Reduces gas costs
- Splits orders for better execution

## MEV Protection

### Types of MEV
- **Frontrunning**: Executing before a known transaction
- **Sandwiching**: Surrounding a transaction with buy/sell orders
- **Backrunning**: Following large trades for profit

### Protection Mechanisms
1. **Commit-Reveal**: Hide bid details until execution
2. **Private Mempools**: Bypass public transaction pools
3. **Time-Delay**: Add randomness to execution timing

## Performance Targets

- Bid submission: < 5ms
- Auction clearing: < 10ms
- Settlement: < 20ms
- CFMM routing: < 15ms
