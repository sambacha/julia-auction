# Julia Auction System

## Document Information
**Updated:** 2024
**Type:** Technical Documentation
**Status:** Active Development

## Executive Summary

The Julia Auction System implements advanced auction mechanisms for research and simulation. Core functionality includes first-price, Vickrey, and augmented uniform price auctions with comprehensive bidding strategies. The system provides simulation frameworks, visualization tools, and configuration management for auction research.

## System Overview

### Core Capabilities

Researchers use the Julia Auction System to simulate and analyze auction mechanisms. The system implements classical auction types alongside innovative augmented mechanisms that address bid shading through elastic supply schedules.

**Key Components:**
- Auction mechanisms with multiple bidding strategies
- Simulation framework for performance analysis
- Configuration system with TOML-based settings
- Visualization tools for bid analysis

### Current Status

The system operates as a research platform with core auction functionality complete. Settlement systems and CFMM integration remain under development. See [Development Status](guides/production_status.md) for detailed information.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Julia 1.6+ and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/julia-auction.git
cd julia-auction
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

### Quick Example

Create and run a basic auction:

```julia
include("src/AuctionSimulator.jl")

# Create bidders with strategies
bidders = [
    Bidder(1, 50.0, TruthfulBidder()),
    Bidder(2, 45.0, ShadedBidder(0.1)),
    Bidder(3, 60.0, StrategicBidder())
]

# Run first-price auction
auction = FirstPriceAuction(10.0, 1)
result = conduct_auction(bidders, auction)

println("Winner: $(result.winner_id)")
println("Price: $(result.winning_price)")
```
