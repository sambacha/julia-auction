# Julia Auction System Documentation

## Welcome

The Julia Auction System provides production-ready implementations of advanced auction mechanisms with a focus on efficiency, fairness, and computational performance.

## Quick Start

Get started with the Julia Auction System in minutes:

```julia
using AuctionSystem

# Create elastic supply schedule
supply = ElasticSupplySchedule(
    base_quantity = 1000.0,
    price_floor = 10.0,
    price_ceiling = 100.0,
    elasticity = 0.5
)

# Run augmented auction
result = run_auction(bids, AuctionConfig(
    supply_schedule = supply,
    tie_breaking = AugmentedTieBreaking(0.7, 0.3)
))

println("Clearing price: $(result.clearing_price)")
```

## Key Features

- **Augmented Uniform Price Auctions** - Addresses bid shading with elastic supply
- **Post-CFMM Settlement** - Integration with DeFi liquidity pools
- **MEV Protection** - Comprehensive protection against value extraction
- **Production Hardening** - Built for high-volume, low-latency operations
