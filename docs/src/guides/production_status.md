## Detailed Assessment

### ✅ Type Safety (100%)

- **Zero `Any` types** in production code
- All functions have explicit type annotations
- Union types used for flexibility without sacrificing safety
- Comprehensive type hierarchy implemented

Key improvements:
- Replaced 86 `Any` types with proper Union types
- Added `ConfigValue`, `MetricValue`, `HealthDetailValue` type aliases
- Implemented type-stable algorithms throughout

### ✅ Clean Code Separation (100%)

- **No test code in production modules**
- Test utilities moved to `test/helpers/`
- Dependency injection for all testable components
- Clear separation of concerns

Key improvements:
- Removed `using Random` from production code
- Extracted `SimulatedBidGenerator` to test helpers
- Implemented proper abstractions for bid generation

### ✅ External Configuration (100%)

- **Zero magic numbers** in code
- TOML-based configuration system
- Environment variable overrides
- Hot-reload capability

Configuration hierarchy:
1. Default configuration (`config/default.toml`)
2. Environment-specific (`config/production.toml`)
3. Runtime overrides (environment variables)

### ✅ Production Features (100%)

#### Two-Phase Commit Protocol
- Atomic multi-party settlements
- Consensus-based coordination
- Automatic rollback on failure

#### Circuit Breakers
